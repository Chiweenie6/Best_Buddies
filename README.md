## Usage  
  This API will allow a social networking site to handle large amounts of data in an unstructured form. The user has the ability to create posts/thoughts to share with friends. Users can add their own reactions to friend's posts. Things change, so the posts/thouhgts and reactions can also be changed/updated. If the user chooses, they can also delete their posts and reactions. Users can also add friends to their profile to see what their friend's are up to and saying.
